# This GitHub Action workflow lints and formats Python code using Ruff.
# It runs on every pull request.
#
# The workflow has the following steps:
# 1. Checks out the code.
# 2. Installs uv, the fast Python package installer.
# 3. Sets up a Python environment and installs ruff using uv.
# 4. Runs 'ruff check --fix' to find and automatically fix linting errors,
#    capturing the command's output. This step will fail if there are any
#    errors that ruff cannot fix automatically.
# 5. If linting was successful, it commits any auto-fixed files. The commit
#    message will include the output from the initial ruff run.
# 6. Runs 'ruff format' to ensure consistent code formatting.
# 7. Commits any files that were changed by the formatter.
